## Intro
Originally a hack for Tech Crunch Disrput - San Francisco in 2015. Drug Safety Portal v1.0 was only consumer facing, allowing regular people to look what can be the potential issues of taking two drugs together. By combining APIs and research datasets, this application gave all possible evidence of drug interactions to users. Invited to further develop this app during the 2016 Biohackthon. 

## Objectives during Biohackthon:
- Further standardization of resource
- Enable researchers to upload (and automatically standardize) their published DDI resources
- Provide facilities to download data
- Proper linkage with open linked data resources
- Allow people to Tweet to Drug Safety Portal
- Keep track of user queries for investigation of possibly new DDIs

## Pivoting Idea
Drug Safety Portal collects PUBLISHED drug-drug interactions….. Why not be a repository for unpublished ones …. Make it a full-fledged data repository!!

- Allow researchers to check if they are on the right path
- Keep all drug safety research in a centralized location
- Standardize all drug safety research before publication!
